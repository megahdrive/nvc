# nvc
N(oobas) version control. Version control for the masses. Please don't actually use this, it literally zips your code in a file. Just use 7-zip.

## Usage
nvc.exe [directory]

## Building
This should build on any system, but it's being tested on Windows 11 amd64 and I cant be bothered to test.
