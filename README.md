# nvc
N(oobas) version control. Version control for the masses.
### What is it?
NVC is a meme version control software, designed after my friends' bad version control system.
### Why use it?
Ever wanted to control your versions by date and without a great piece of software? Well NVC lets you do that!
### How does it work?
NVC controls your versions by creating a ZIP file of your code, titled after the date it was created.

## Usage
nvc.exe [directory]

## Building
This should build on any system, but it's being tested on Windows 11 amd64 and I cant be bothered to test.
