# nvc
N(oobas) version control. Version control for the masses. Please note if you actually want to use version control software like this either consider not doing it or using the [rust port](https://github.com/megahdrive/nvc-rust)
### What is it?
NVC is a meme version control software, designed after my friends' bad version control system.
### Why use it?
Ever wanted to control your versions by date and without a great piece of software? Well NVC lets you do that!
### How does it work?
NVC controls your versions by creating a ZIP file of your code, titled after the date it was created.

## Usage
nvc.exe [directory]

## Building
```shell
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

## Supported systems
This *should* build and run fine on any system, but I can't guarantee it and I can't be bothered to test. (Tested on Windows 11, Amd64)
